Hello, I am **Muzammil Saifi** a Software Engineer with a passion and love for
learning and creating useful software for myself and anyone with intresting 
enough problem to solve.

I have liked tinkering with software form a **young age** be it rooting my Mom's android
device or installing custom roms. It seemed natural to me to choose this career
path. In my college years I mostly focused on web development and developed few
of my projects like tech-ion and MyMusicList.

I am **proefficient** in frontend development using React and Nextjs having built
multiple projects using these technologies, In the backend I have used Nodejs with
express Nextjs server components. I have also dabbled in Java and Go and have 
a basic understanding of the languages.

I developed **this website** because of the love for terminals I have especially since
I started using Linux as my primary OS for development along with Neovim(btw) as my
primary text/code editor. Its built using hugo static site generator for that sweet
sweet high speed performance

I have an average **typing speed** of 60wpm using touch typing that I taught myself.
I have **graduated** form my Bachelors in Computer Science with 9.8 CGPA
from Mumbai University

*Thanks for reading, Muzammil Saifi*
