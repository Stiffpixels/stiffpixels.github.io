My Music List was a personal project I worked on to help people record their listening journey so they can in a way store memories.
I was looking for something similar to myanimelist for music but couldn't find it so I created my own.

### UI
The homepage consist of a navbar with links to pages: home, contact, login, signup. Below the navbar is where you will find a list
of all the music I have added for now its only 2 as I moved image storage to cloudinary for better performance. Each music is in 
the form of a card with title, links and description. If you click on the view more link it will take you to the individual music
page
